The draconian measure instantly cut off access to the United States for 218 million people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It indefinitely suspended the admission of Syrian refugees.</p> <p><strong><span class='caps'>AMY</span> <span class='caps'>GOODMAN</span>:</strong> Across the world, travelers were left stranded, while scores were detained by customs officials after landing at U.S. airports. As news of the order spread Saturday, thousands gathered at <span class='caps'>JFK</span> airport in New York City for an impromptu protest. <em>Democracy Now!</em>&#8217;s Nermeen Shaikh was there.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><span class='caps'>PROTESTERS</span>:</strong> Let them in! Let them in! Let them in! Let them in! Let them in! Let them in!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>NERMEEN</span> <span class='caps'>SHAIKH</span>:</strong> We&#8217;re outside New York City&#8217;s John F. Kennedy airport, outside Terminal 4, where thousands of people have gathered to protest the Trump administration&#8217;s executive order, which has prevented many people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, more than 10 of them here detained at Terminal 4. Thousands of people here are chanting &quot;Let them in!&quot; &quot;This is what democracy looks like! and &quot;Refugees welcome here.&quot; Let&#8217;s talk to some of the people here.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>MOUMITA</span> <span class='caps'>AHMED</span>:</strong> My name is Moumita Ahmed, and I&#8217;m here today because, as a Muslim woman, I find this ban extremely just personal to me, because I have family members who are on visa, and now they&#8217;re—they are at risk of not being able to leave or enter the country. And again, as a Muslim, I feel like this is targeting our community in an unfair way. I was here since 12:30, and before, it was like a hundred people that showed up. And then we were live-streaming. I actually tweeted for people to be here, and it had like 2,000 retweets. And then, just I was live-streaming, which I got a lot of shares, like almost a thousand shares. And I think other people that were here did the same thing. And next thing you know, there&#8217;s like entire huge crowds started showing up. And now there&#8217;s protests happening all over the country.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>PROTESTERS</span>:</strong> No hate! No fear! Refugees are welcome here!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>SHERRY</span>:</strong> My name is Sherry, and I&#8217;m here as a Jewish American who is very aware of what we did just a couple generations ago, and I don&#8217;t want to see us do this again. Muslims are my brothers, and they deserve to be here just as much as I do. And no person is illegal. So I&#8217;m here to express that on this super-cold night.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>DAVID</span>:</strong> My name&#8217;s David. I live here in New York. I&#8217;m from Texas, but my parents are from Vietnam.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>NERMEEN</span> <span class='caps'>SHAIKH</span>:</strong> And what brings you here tonight?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>DAVID</span>:</strong> I am angry. I am so angry at this. If it wasn&#8217;t for the country letting my parents in here when they were refugees, none of us would be here. New York is made up of immigrants and refugees. And this is infuriating.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>NERMEEN</span> <span class='caps'>SHAIKH</span>:</strong> So your parents came here as refugees?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>DAVID</span>:</strong> They did, from Vietnam. My entire family did. And it&#8217;s absurd that Muslims are being targeted. It&#8217;s ridiculous. When my parents first came to this country, they had nothing, and they came here with a hope to escape their country and everything horrible that was going on over in Vietnam, and to build a life. And they built a life from scratch here. They paid their taxes. They had their children. They looked to America as a beacon of hope. And it&#8217;s unfair that right now we want to ban Muslims. It&#8217;s terrible.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>LIONEL</span>:</strong> My name is Lionel, and I&#8217;m from Brazil, but I&#8217;ve been here for over 20 years. I went through the green card process. I know how much of a vetting process that actually is already, and even just the visa process. And I know that it takes very little of a suspicious note in your résumé, in your history, as a person, of your family, to even be not allowed in at that point. So, to even add to that something so ridiculous and arbitrary as a Muslim ban, it makes absolutely no sense and is completely xenophobic.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>NERMEEN</span> <span class='caps'>SHAIKH</span>:</strong> The people who are being prevented from entering the U.S. even include legal permanent residents, people who have green cards, from those seven countries that have been designated by the Trump administration.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>LIONEL</span>:</strong> That&#8217;s correct. I mean, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s even more appalling about it. But just from a basic level, we shouldn&#8217;t turn people away. That&#8217;s what this country was founded on. And it&#8217;s not just that; it&#8217;s just common human decency. You&#8217;re keeping people from escaping a country that you, yourself, have destroyed.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>RUHI</span> <span class='caps'>KAPURIA</span>:</strong> My name is Ruhi Kapuria [<i>phon.</i>], and I&#8217;m from Long Island, Valley Stream.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>NERMEEN</span> <span class='caps'>SHAIKH</span>:</strong> What are your concerns for Muslims who are here already in the U.S. under a Trump administration, under this administration?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>RUHI</span> <span class='caps'>KAPURIA</span>:</strong> Well, I would say, all my Muslim brothers and sisters, there&#8217;s nothing to fear. Your actions are more important. Keep doing what you&#8217;re doing, and we are not going to do anything wrong. We are going to be unapologetic Muslims.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>PROTESTERS</span>:</strong> Whose country? Our country! Whose country? Our country!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>SHERRY</span>:</strong> I heard that there was one man that was released earlier today, and I hope that with the pressure of a lot of electeds who are here tonight—I was standing with a bunch of city council people—thousands of people here, that the shame and embarrassment of doing this act and everyone seeing you will help it stop. Now, that being said, that&#8217;s just today. So what happens like a month from now, when people just—you know, they&#8217;re still stuck in their country, they&#8217;re not here at the airport? This is the dramatic thing, when they&#8217;re here at the airport. I&#8217;m worried almost more about what happens a few weeks from now, when people who are expecting to come here from refugee camps just can&#8217;t come. We won&#8217;t see those people. We&#8217;re all very aware of the 10 or so inside. I&#8217;m worried more almost about what happens with the people we&#8217;re not going to be as aware of, you know?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>NERMEEN</span> <span class='caps'>SHAIKH</span>:</strong> Outside a very cold Terminal 4 at New York City&#8217;s John F. Kennedy airport, I&#8217;m Nermeen Shaikh, with Sam Alcoff and Anna Ozbek, for <em>Democracy Now!</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>PROTESTERS</span>:</strong> [singing] <em>From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters, this land was made for you and me.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>JUAN</span> GONZÁLEZ:</strong> Protests spread to other airports—in Boston, Washington, D.C., Seattle, Atlanta, San Francisco. President Trump&#8217;s order also drew immediate legal challenges. On Saturday, the <span class='caps'>ACLU</span> asked a federal judge to intervene in the case of two Iraqis detained at <span class='caps'>JFK</span> airport. At Saturday night, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in Brooklyn ordered the men released as part of a nationwide stay on part of Trump&#8217;s executive order. Her ruling temporarily blocked the deportation of valid visa holders, including those from countries listed in Trump&#8217;s ban.</p><p><strong><span class='caps'>AMY</span> <span class='caps'>GOODMAN</span>:</strong> In Boston, Carl Williams, a lawyer from the <span class='caps'>ACLU</span>, announced the legal victory while standing in front of hundreds of protesters at Logan International Airport.</p><blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>CARL</span> <span class='caps'>WILLIAMS</span>:</strong> [echoed by the People&#8217;s Mic] The <span class='caps'>ACLU</span> nationally filed for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> to stop this nationally. A judge in New York just granted that. The legal premise that we&#8217;ve learned tonight is that when we fight, we win!</p></blockquote><p><strong><span class='caps'>AMY</span> <span class='caps'>GOODMAN</span>:</strong> Judges in California, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington quickly followed with similar rulings, and the Department of Homeland Security said Sunday it would comply with the orders. But some lawmakers report Customs and Border Protection officers are defying the courts. We&#8217;ll be back with more on Donald Trump&#8217;s executive order and the mass protests across the country.

For an example, the very country to whom our people were taken as slaves during the transatlantic slave trade have now decided to ban refugees from some of our countries. What do we do about this?

	article: "On Monday, The Council on American-Islamic-Relations filed a federal lawsuit against Trump’s executive order, which it refers to as a 'Muslim Exclusion Order.'' The lawsuit argues the executive order is unconstitutional and violates the First Amendment’s religious freedom protections and the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection. This is CAIR lawyer Gadeir Abbas. <br><blockquote>Gadeir Abbas: 'President Trump’s actions are not simply words on paper. They’re the grandest monument to anti-Muslim sentiment that America has ever known. We’re not talking about the 15th Amendment or an amendment later in the teens or the 20s. We’re talking about the very first amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits a government from favoring one faith over another. And there are few times in American history where the government has officially disfavored a whole a religious faith, and this is one of those instances.'</blockquote>",

	article: "And the Army Corps of Engineers appears poised to approve the final permit required to build the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline, which has faced months of resistance from hundreds of indigenous nations and non-Native allies. On Tuesday, North Dakota Senator John Hoeven said he had spoken with acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer and that Speer has directed the Army Corps to issue the easement for Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, to drill underneath the Missouri River. The Standing Rock Sioux and many more fear a pipeline spill could contaminate the river, which serves as a drinking water source for millions. Water protectors say that if the easement is granted, the government would be illegally circumventing the process of an environmental impact statement, which was ordered in December under President Obama’s administration. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said, 'To abandon the EIS would amount to a wholly unexplained and arbitrary change based on the President’s personal views and, potentially, personal investments.' Members of the resistance camp Sacred Stone on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota have called for water protectors to come to support the resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline.",

For more, we speak with two women who played key roles during the Nixon years.

	article: "Protests also continued in cities nationwide against Trump’s executive order temporarily banning all refugees, as well as all citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen—from entering the United States. In Minneapolis, an estimated 5,000 people flooded into the streets around the Federal Building. The Anti-War Committee, which organized the protest, said, 'It is criminal for the U.S. to bomb and attack other countries and then turn away refugees when the U.S. has destroyed their homelands.' In Columbia, South Carolina, over 600 people gathered at the State House to denounce Trump’s Muslim ban. Legal challenges to the ban also grew Tuesday as the states of Washington, Massachusetts, Virginia and New York all joined lawsuits against Trump’s executive order. This is Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. Maura Healey: 'The executive order is harmful, discriminatory and unconstitutional. It discriminates on the basis of religion and national origin, denies our residents access to due process and equal protection of the law and violates federal immigration law. The role of this office is to uphold the law and the Constitution of this state and of the United States.' As many as 1,000 State Department diplomats and officials have signed on to a dissent memo that condemns Trump’s Muslim ban. That’s far more signatures than any other dissent memo signed in recent years. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tried to claim the executive order is not a 'ban.' That’s despite the fact that both Spicer and President Trump have repeatedly called the executive order a ban, including multiple times on Monday. On Tuesday, Spicer also tried to defend authorities’ decision to handcuff a 5-year-old U.S. citizen for hours at the Dulles International Airport in Virginia after the boy returned from a trip to Iran, by claiming the boy could have posed a security threat. Trump has falsely claimed that only 109 people have been denied entry to the U.S. since the ban was imposed. In fact, officials with Customs and Border Protection said Tuesday at least 721 people have been denied entry into the United States. Editor’s Note: This morning’s headlines also included a claim by a man who told WJBK in Detroit that his mother, a 75-year-old Iraqi-American green card holder, died after being denied entry into the United States. An imam in Detroit has since told the station that the woman died in Iraq five days before the ban was put in place.",

Yates had written a memo saying, 'I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful.' Yates had served in the Justice Department for 27 years. Trump had asked her to serve as acting attorney general until the Senate confirmed Sen. Jeff Sessions, who is a close ally of Trump. On Monday, Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal praised Sally Yates for speaking out. Sen. Richard Blumenthal: 'I want to salute Sally Yates, who has taken a stand based on moral and legal principle in the highest tradition of the Department of Justice, saying that these orders cannot be defended, that the rule of law and morality is more important than the politics of the moment and the impulsive edicts of a ruler who apparently fails to understand that law, or at least his administration does.'",

I was questioned extensively, in part, among other things, about my views about the political situation in Sudan, about whether or not I knew of radical groups in Sudan, whether I knew people who had radical views. I was asked to share my social media handles—not my passwords, but my social media handles. Then I was asked to kind of sit tight and wait as they were trying to figure out what was going on, because the order had literally just been signed, so—or they were just getting notice of it, so they really—the officers didn’t really know what they were doing. And they told me, eventually, that I needed to get transferred to Terminal 4, which is a 24-hour holding area. And before doing that, I had to be patted down. And so, I was led into a room. I was patted down. It was a very uncomfortable pat-down. I was touched in my chest and groin area. And then I was handcuffed briefly. That’s when I started to cry, because I felt like—at that moment, I felt like, 'OK, I’m probably going to get deported.' And they didn’t—they realized they hadn’t handcuffed the other person who was with me, who was an Iranian green card holder, and so they took off the handcuffs, transferred us to Terminal 4. There were other people at this point that were getting led in in handcuffs who were Iranian and Iraqi citizens with valid visas. Eventually, I got out, after five hours. And I was told—I asked the officer if I would be able to go back to Sudan, because I haven’t finished my dissertation research. And he recommended that I not go back, unless I was willing to be subjected to that whole procedure again.

	article: "AMY GOODMAN: So this is an incredible educational moment. Can you talk about Frederick Douglass’s life and what people around the world should know about him? KENNETH MORRIS JR.: Well, both of my ancestors, Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington, were born into slavery. And they were born into the most horrific conditions that a human being could be subjected to. But yet, through the power of education, both of my ancestors understood from a very young age that education equals freedom. And for Frederick Douglass, at the age of nine years old, he was sent from the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where he was born on a plantation, to go to Baltimore to be the house servant for his master’s brother. And when he got there, his slave mistress had never had slaves before, and she didn’t know that it was illegal to teach him to read and write, so she began to teach young Frederick his ABCs. But when his master found out about it, he got angry, and he forbade it. And he looked at Frederick, and he looked at his wife Sophia, and he said, 'You cannot teach a slave how to read and write, because if you do, it will unfit him to be a slave.'' And Frederick looked at his master, and he heard that message loud and clear, and he understood right then and there that education would be his pathway to freedom. At the age of 20 in 1838, he would have the courage to run away from slavery. He would eventually settle in New Bedford, Massachusetts. And instead of just saying, 'I’m free now. I’ll start a family and get a job,' he looked back, and he saw that there was this institution of legalized slavery that needed to be dismantled. And he, along with the other abolitionists, got to work and worked on ending slavery. He became an adviser to President Abraham Lincoln, and then a statesman, the first African American to be nominated for vice president. He was counsel general to Haiti. And his contributions really tell us that he was a true American hero.",
